FRESHKEEP TODO - HIGH PRIORITY FIXES & MISSING FEATURES

=== CRITICAL BROKEN FEATURES ===

1. Add Item Form (add.html) - No form submission handler
   - Form exists but no JavaScript to process submissions
   - Buttons don't connect to any functionality
   - Location: add.html - missing form submit handlers

2. Pantry Management (pantry.html) - Functions missing implementations
   - handleSearch(), handleSort(), editItem(), deleteItem() - called but not defined
   - loadPantryData() function incomplete - no data source
   - Location: pantry.html:467-695 - function stubs only

3. Scanner Functionality - Placeholder only
   - Barcode scanner UI exists but no actual scanning logic
   - QuaggaJS library included but not initialized
   - Location: index.html:5038+ - scanner setup incomplete

4. Settings Page - Empty functionality
   - UI elements present but no JavaScript handlers
   - Location: settings.html - no script functionality

=== MISSING CORE FEATURES ===

1. Data Persistence Layer
   - Firebase config present but requires actual project setup
   - Local storage fallback incomplete in most pages
   - Location: index.html:2510-2543 - needs real Firebase config

2. Form Validation
   - No client-side validation on any forms
   - No error handling for user inputs
   - Location: All forms lack validation

3. Navigation State Management
   - setActiveNavItem() not called on page loads
   - Bottom navigation not consistently implemented
   - Location: shared.js:64-83 - not being used

    - Connect to actual data source
    - Fix broken onclick handlers in pantry.html

PRIORITY 2 - HIGH

    - Set up Firebase project with proper config
    - Implement offline-first data sync

[ ] Scanner Implementation
    - Initialize QuaggaJS barcode scanner
    - Connect scanner results to add item form

PRIORITY 3 - MEDIUM
[ ] Navigation Fixes
    - Fix active page highlighting across all pages
    - Implement consistent bottom navigation
    - Add page transition handling

[ ] Settings Functionality

=== NOTES ===
- App has solid UI/UX design but most core functionality is broken or missing
- The top 3 critical fixes needed are Add Item Form, Pantry Management, and Data Storage
- Without these fixes, the app is essentially a static demo with no working features
- Theme system and navigation UI are working correctly
- Firebase integration is partially implemented but needs real project setup
